üí° Ideas to improve your webpage / dashboard

Based on what you have + what others do well, here are ideas you might add to elevate your product and differentiate:

Client Progress & Metrics

Track stats over time beyond just a calendar: weight, body measurements, maybe even more advanced things like strength (one-rep max), speed, etc.

Visualizations: line/bar charts to show progress trends.

Compliance / Adherence Indicators

Track how often athletes complete assigned workouts (percentage completed vs missed).

Highlight ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù athletes (those falling behind) so coach can intervene early.

Notifications / Reminders / Alerts

Remind coach or athlete of upcoming workouts, end-of-program, expired program, missing inputs.

Maybe push notifications or email reminders.

Client Communication

Messaging feature: direct messages between coach & athlete.

Announcements: coach can push messages/news to all or select athletes.

Possibly allow attachment uploads (images, videos, documents).

Resource Library

Videos or PDF resources: exercise demos, nutrition tips, stretch routines, etc.

Templates for warm-ups, cooldowns, movement quality, mobility, etc.

Customization / Branding

Allow coach/user to set logo, brand colors, fonts, maybe custom theming so the dashboard feels personal / white-label.

Customize client-facing profile pages or portals.

Scheduling & Calendar Enhancements

Integrated scheduling: booking sessions, syncing with common calendar apps (Google Calendar, iCal).

Time-zone support.

Ability to mark rest days, non-training days, etc.

Bundles / Programs Marketplace

Pre-made programs the coach can use or sell/offer to athletes.

Ability for coach to share or sell templates.

Billing / Payments

If you plan to monetize: subscription / payment history, invoices, recurring payment, maybe multiple payment gateways.

Feedback & Check-Ins

Weekly check-in forms: how they felt, soreness, sleep, readiness.

Coach can adjust upcoming sessions based on those inputs.

Photos / Progress Visuals

Before/after photo uploads, side-by-side comparison.

Progress photo galleries.

Analytics & Insights Dashboard for Coach

Show usage metrics: how many athletes active, program completion rates, client retention.

See what programs are most used, which ones have high dropout.

Mobile / Responsive Experience

Ensure all functionality works well on phones/tablets (maybe even a lightweight app or PWA).

Ability to Export Data / Reports

Export program or athlete performance as PDF or CSV.

Share reports with athletes or show them in sessions.

Integrations

Maybe integrate wearables / fitness trackers (Apple Health, Google Fit, Garmin) so workouts can sync or steps/data flow in.

Integration for video (Zoom, etc.) if you offer remote coaching.
